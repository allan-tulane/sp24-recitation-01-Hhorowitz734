1 - Worst case input for linear and binary search
The worst case runtime for binary search is the case
Where the item is not in the list, causing the algorithm
To run for logn iterations

2 - Best case input for binary search
The base case input to my implementation of binary search is one s.t. 
the key is at idx (left + right) // 2, as it then runs for
Only one iteration

The best case for linear search is for the element to be at index 0, as
then it will check that one first.
